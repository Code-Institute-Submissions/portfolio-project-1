# Milestone Portfolio Project

The following project is an online portfolio to demonstrate my web development skills to potential clients. At the moment, I'm still relatively inexperienced so a lot of the site is just an overview of the code languages I'm familiar with.

# UX

Ideally this site will allow users to get a better understanding of me on a professional level. The goal is to create four basic web pages devoted to that end:
- A homepage to introduce myself to the user and explain the purpose of the site.
- A page for explaining my and education and experience in web development.
- A portfolio page to present my work.
- A contact page for potential clients to reach out to me for work.  


## User stories

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.        
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about coding challenges.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.        
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

-   #### Frequent User Goals
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.
    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.
    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

## Frameworks, Libraries, Websites & Programs Used
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrap.com/): This library provided examples of responsive code that were vital to the functionality of my project, such as the collapsable navigation bar and contact form.

- [Font Awesome](https://www.fontawesome.com/): This was very useful for styling the fonts of different text elements.

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): The code on the site served as the template for several styling elements I had difficulty with.

- [Photoshop](https://photoshop.com/en): This was neccesary in order to create certain images and visual elements.

- [Git/GitHub](https://github.com/): GitHub was the program used to design and ultimately launch the code for this project.



## Testing
This project utilized the W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator for testing the competency of the code on each page.

- WSC Markup - [Result]()
